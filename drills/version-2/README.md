# Javascript Calculator

Use Javascript to build a basic calculator using the provided HTML and CSS. You'll only need to edit app.js

![Example](screenshots/example.gif)

More specifically, as a developer, you will need to do the following:

- Add a click handler to each number and operator button that takes the number/operator displayed on the button and displays it in the "screen"
- Add a click handler to the "clear" button that removes all text from the screen
- Add a click handler to the "equal" button that evaluates the expression shown on the screen
  - If the expression is in format `operand(+|-|x|รท)operand`, evaluate the expression and update the screen with the result.
  - Hint: Check out eval()  (For this drill only!)
- When attempting to divide by zero, update the screen with the message `Error`
